Description:
    The class table inheritance migration generator creates a migration for adding a table used by
    the class table inheritance plugin.

    The generator takes a migration name as its argument.  The migration name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its number
    in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate class_table_inheritance_migration AddClassTableInheritance

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an AddClassTableInheritance migration in the
    file db/migrate/005_add_class_table_inheritance.rb
